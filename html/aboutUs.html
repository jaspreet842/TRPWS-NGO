        <h1>-- OUR APPROACH --</h1>
        <p>We reach out to children and make them interact with young people from universities and teach them in a
            friendly way so as to provide them with a family environment for learning, make them understand our culture
            and hardships they need to overcome in the journey of their life.</p>
        <p>Our main motives are making children aware of the current scenario in which the world exists and train them
            to overcome the taboos of society. We also make them aware of the social issues they are in and how to make
            it a better place for them to survive and grow.</p>
        <p>A well defined smile is what we care for and try to achieve with our constant approach.</p>
